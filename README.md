# MATLABrealsense
3D camera(Intel SR300) paremeter setup app

COLOR CALIBRATION WARNING: ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH MATLAB 2018b and beyond (uses axes passed to uifigure, feature not available until that version).

**color calibration:** capture with camera seems to be working correctly requires further testing. Other options work normally.
***************************************************************************************************************************************
**compatibility(tested):** SR300

**platform:** MATLAB's appdesigner

**authors:**

UX/implementation: Alexandre Silva, Robert Kirkman;

stream scripts:  Ben Bryant, Alexandre Silva

color calibration: Dr. Hamed Sari-Sarraf (developed the automatic color checker detection algorithm), Alexandre Silva (finding and sampling colors based on patches' detection; regression task and UX);

ivcam UI: Joel Reznick, Yousef Saed.

**Description:**
This app uses the previous (now deprecated) version of the Intel Realsense library. You don't need to install the SDK to use this app; just download the cloned repository it and double click the file MATLABRealsense.mlapp.

1. REQUIREMENT: you must have C/C++ compilers supported by Matlab to run the app (tested with Visual Studio Community's compilers)
2. Connect the camera before running MATLAB; 
3. run MATLAB as an adminstrator on Windows to use the app;

Capabilities:

  - set RGB parameters (brightness, contrast etc) settings
  
  - set depth parameters through Ivcam presets
  
  - saving the parameters set to a mat file
  
  - loading saved parameters back to the camera (including ivcam depth parameters)
  
  - RGB, depth, infrared, and point cloud (color projection onto depth) streams
  
  - color calibration with automatic detection of Macbeth color checker as target. It's based on Bastani and Funt's paper about normalized least-squares regression). You can save the transformation matrix for later use or use it to batch process a folder, among other things.

Near future planned features:
  -point cloud capture
  -color calibration from camera capture

OSB: an error audio signal plays after a steam figure is closed. It's not high in my priorities list to investigate that (since Matlab does not show an error message together with the audio) but it'd be cool if somebody did it.
